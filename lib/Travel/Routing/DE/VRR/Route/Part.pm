=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Travel::Routing::DE::VRR::Route::Part> holds one specific connection (without
interchanges) between two points.  It specifies the start/stop point and time,
the train line and its destination, and optional additional data.

It is usually obtained by a call to Travel::Routing::DE::VRR::Route(3pm)'s
B<parts> method.
